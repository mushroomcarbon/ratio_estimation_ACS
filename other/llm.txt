get me the number of doctoral degrees in each state
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
To extract the number of doctoral degrees (EDUCD = 116) in each state, the approach will depend on the format of the dataset you have. If you're working with a CSV or similar structured file, you can use a tool like Python and Pandas to analyze the data.

Here’s a Python snippet that performs this calculation assuming your data is in a CSV file named data.csv:

python
Copy code
import pandas as pd

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Filter for rows where educational attainment (EDUCD) is equal to 116 (Doctoral degree)
doctoral_data = data[data['EDUCD'] == 116]

# Group by state (STATEICP) and count the number of occurrences
statewise_doctoral_counts = doctoral_data.groupby





You said:
use R
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
If you're using R, you can use the following code to calculate the number of people with a doctoral degree in each state. This assumes you have a CSV file named data.csv and that it contains the variables mentioned in your codebook:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)

# Load the data
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Filter for rows where educational attainment (EDUCD) is equal to 116 (Doctoral degree)
doctoral_data <- data %>% filter(EDUCD == 116)

# Group by state (STATEICP) and count the number of doctoral degrees
statewise_doctoral_counts <- doctoral_data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Doctoral_Count = n())

# Print the results
print(statewise_doctoral_counts)
Explanation:
read.csv("data.csv"): Reads your CSV file.
filter(EDUCD == 116): Filters rows where EDUCD equals 116 (Doctoral degrees).
group_by(STATEICP): Groups data by STATEICP (State identifier).
summarise(Doctoral_Count = n()): Counts the number of rows per group (number of doctoral degrees per state).
This will produce a table showing the count of individuals with a doctoral degree for each state. If your data is stored in a different format or file, adjust the file reading command accordingly (e.g., read.csv for CSV or read.table for other formats).

If I tell you that there were 391,171 respondents in California (STATEICP) across all levels of education, then can you please use the ratio estimators approach of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents in each state i.e. take the ratio that you worked out for California and apply it to the rest of the states. (Hint: You can now work out the ratio between the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in a state and number of respondents in a state and then apply that ratio to your column of the number of respondents with a doctoral degree in each state.)
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
Given the information, we can estimate the total number of respondents in each state using a ratio estimation approach. The procedure involves using the known total number of respondents in California (391,171) and applying a ratio based on the proportion of respondents with doctoral degrees in California to other states. Here’s how we can implement it in R:

Step-by-Step Explanation:
Calculate Ratio for California:
First, determine the ratio of respondents with a doctoral degree in California to the total number of respondents in California.
Calculate the Total Respondents for Each State:
Use the ratio calculated above and apply it to the count of doctoral degrees in other states. The assumption is that the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents is the same for each state.
Implementation in R:
Here's the R code that will accomplish this:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary library
library(dplyr)

# Assuming `data.csv` is the file containing your data
# Load the dataset
data <- read.csv("data.csv")

# Filter rows where the educational attainment is a doctoral degree
doctoral_data <- data %>% filter(EDUCD == 116)

# Calculate the number of doctoral degrees in each state
state_doctoral_counts <- doctoral_data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Doctoral_Count = n())

# Set known values
california_doctoral_count <- state_doctoral_counts %>% filter(STATEICP == 71) %>% pull(Doctoral_Count)
california_total_respondents <- 391,171  # Given

# Calculate the ratio for California (Doctoral Count / Total Respondents)
california_ratio <- california_doctoral_count / california_total_respondents

# Estimate total respondents in each state using the California ratio
state_estimated_total_respondents <- state_doctoral_counts %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = Doctoral_Count / california_ratio)

# View the estimated total respondents for each state
print(state_estimated_total_respondents)
Explanation:
filter(EDUCD == 116) filters the data for respondents with a doctoral degree.
group_by(STATEICP) groups the data by state.
summarise(Doctoral_Count = n()) counts the number of doctoral degrees in each state.
california_doctoral_count retrieves the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California.
california_ratio calculates the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents in California.
mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = Doctoral_Count / california_ratio) applies the ratio to estimate the total respondents in each state.
This approach uses the ratio derived from California as a reference and estimates total respondents in other states proportionally.

To replace the STATEICP codes with the actual state names, you can create a lookup table that maps the codes to state names. Here's how you can do it:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the data
data <- read.csv(here::here("data/data.csv"))

# Filter for rows where educational attainment (EDUCD) is equal to 116 (Doctoral degree)
doctoral_data <- data %>% filter(EDUCD == 116)

# Group by state (STATEICP) and count the number of doctoral degrees
statewise_doctoral_counts <- doctoral_data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Doctoral_Count = n())

# Create a lookup table for STATEICP to state name mapping
state_lookup <- data.frame(
  STATEICP = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 96, 97, 98, 99),
  State = c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont", "Delaware", 
            "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Michigan", "Ohio", "Wisconsin",
            "Iowa", "Kansas", "Minnesota", "Missouri", "Nebraska", "North Dakota", "South Dakota", "Virginia",

# Merge the state names into the doctoral counts dataframe
statewise_doctoral_counts <- statewise_doctoral_counts %>%
  left_join(state_lookup, by = "STATEICP")

# Select only the State and Doctoral_Count columns and remove STATEICP
statewise_doctoral_counts <- statewise_doctoral_counts %>%
  select(State, Doctoral_Count)

# Save the result to a CSV file
write.csv(statewise_doctoral_counts, here::here("data/statewise_doctoral_counts.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# View the resulting dataframe
print(statewise_doctoral_counts)
Explanation:
Create state_lookup Table: A dataframe that maps STATEICP codes to their corresponding state names.
Merge with statewise_doctoral_counts: Use left_join() to combine the counts of doctoral degrees with the state names.
Select Relevant Columns: Keep only the State and Doctoral_Count columns.
Save to CSV: Use write.csv() to save the final dataframe as statewise_doctoral_counts.csv in the data directory.
This will produce a CSV file with the counts of doctoral degrees in each state, along with the corresponding state names.

To use the previously created CSV file (statewise_doctoral_counts.csv) and apply the Laplace ratio estimators approach, here's an updated script:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the CSV file that contains the real data with state names and doctoral counts
real_data <- read.csv(here::here("data/statewise_doctoral_counts.csv"))

# Define the total number of respondents in California across all levels of education
california_total_respondents <- 391171  # Given value

# Extract the number of doctoral respondents in California from the CSV file
california_doctoral_count <- real_data %>% filter(State == "California") %>% pull(Doctoral_Count)

# Calculate the ratio for California using Laplace ratio estimator approach
california_ratio <- california_doctoral_count / california_total_respondents

# Estimate the total number of respondents for each state using the ratio estimator approach
real_data <- real_data %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = Doctoral_Count / california_ratio)

# Compare the estimates with the actual total number of respondents (assuming you have the actual totals)
# If you have another CSV file with the actual total respondents, you can read that file too.
# Here, we'll create a dummy column for demonstration:
real_data$Actual_Total_Respondents <- NA  # Replace with actual data if available

# Save the resulting dataframe to a new CSV file
write.csv(real_data, here::here("data/estimated_statewise_total_respondents.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# Print the resulting dataframe
print(real_data)
Explanation:
Read the Real Data CSV: This step reads the CSV file (statewise_doctoral_counts.csv) that you created earlier with the actual state names and doctoral counts.
Define California Respondents: The script uses the given number of total respondents for California (391,171).
Calculate the Ratio: It calculates the ratio between doctoral degree holders and the total respondents for California.
Estimate Total Respondents for Each State: Using the ratio estimator, the script estimates the total number of respondents in each state.
Save and Display: The results are saved to a new CSV file named estimated_statewise_total_respondents.csv and displayed for review.
If you have the actual total number of respondents for each state in another CSV file, you can merge that with real_data and use it for comparison. Let me know if you have any specific CSV file for the actual respondent counts, and I'll help integrate it into the script.

No problem! Here's an updated script that reads the actual total respondents from the raw data file (data.csv) and estimates the total respondents using the Laplace ratio approach. It then compares these estimates with the actual totals from the data:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the raw data file
data <- read.csv(here::here("data/data.csv"))

# Read the CSV file that contains the statewise doctoral counts with state names

# Calculate the total number of respondents in each state from the raw data
statewise_total_counts <- data %>%

# Define the total number of respondents in California (given value)
california_total_respondents <- 391171

# Extract the number of doctoral respondents in California from the CSV file
california_doctoral_count <- statewise_data %>% filter(State == "California") %>% pull(Doctoral_Count)

# Calculate the ratio for California using Laplace ratio estimator approach
california_ratio <- california_doctoral_count / california_total_respondents

# Estimate the total number of respondents for each state using the ratio estimator approach
statewise_data <- statewise_data %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = Doctoral_Count / california_ratio)

# Save the resulting dataframe to a new CSV file
write.csv(statewise_data, here::here("data/estimated_vs_actual_statewise_total_respondents.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# Print the resulting dataframe
print(statewise_data)
Explanation:
Read Raw Data File: The script reads the raw data (data.csv) containing all respondents.
Calculate Actual Total Respondents per State: Using group_by(STATEICP) and summarise(), the script calculates the total number of respondents in each state.
Merge Doctoral Data with Total Respondents: It merges the previously created CSV (statewise_doctoral_counts.csv) with the actual totals.
Estimate Total Respondents Using Laplace Ratio Estimator: The script estimates the total respondents for each state using the ratio from California.
Save and Display: The final results are saved to a CSV (estimated_vs_actual_statewise_total_respondents.csv) and displayed for review.
This script ensures that the actual respondent numbers are read from the raw data and uses that information for the comparison. Let me know if this fits your needs or if you'd like any modifications!






You said:
issue: cant merge probably because stateicp in raw data is numbr but you converted it to state already
ChatGPT said:
ChatGPT
You're correct—if the STATEICP in the raw data is a numeric column and in the statewise_doctoral_counts.csv it's already replaced with state names, merging will be problematic. We can handle this by converting STATEICP in both datasets to a common format (either both numeric or both as state names).

Here's an updated script that addresses this issue:

# Read the CSV file that contains the statewise doctoral counts with state names
statewise_doctoral_counts <- read.csv(here::here("data/statewise_doctoral_counts.csv"))

# Convert the 'State' column in `statewise_doctoral_counts` to match numeric 'STATEICP' in raw data
# Create a mapping of state names to 'STATEICP' codes
state_icp_mapping <- data.frame(
  STATEICP = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37,

               67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 98), # ICPSR codes
  State = c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont",
            "Delaware", "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Michigan",
            "Ohio", "Wisconsin", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Minnesota", "Missouri", "Nebraska", "North Dakota",

            "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "District of Columbia") # State names
)

# Convert state names back to 'STATEICP' codes for merging purposes
statewise_doctoral_counts <- statewise_doctoral_counts %>%
  left_join(state_icp_mapping, by = "State") %>%
  select(STATEICP, Doctoral_Count, State)  # Retain necessary columns

# Calculate the actual total number of respondents in each state from raw data
statewise_total_counts <- data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Actual_Total_Respondents = n())

# Merge the real data (with 'STATEICP') with the total respondents from raw data
statewise_data <- statewise_doctoral_counts %>%
  left_join(statewise_total_counts, by = "STATEICP")

# Define the total number of respondents in California (given value)
california_total_respondents <- 391171  # Given value for California

# Extract the number of doctoral respondents in California from the merged data
california_doctoral_count <- statewise_data %>% filter(State == "California") %>% pull(Doctoral_Count)

# Calculate the ratio for California using Laplace ratio estimator approach
california_ratio <- california_doctoral_count / california_total_respondents

# Estimate the total number of respondents for each state using the ratio estimator approach
statewise_data <- statewise_data %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = Doctoral_Count / california_ratio)

# Save the resulting dataframe to a new CSV file
write.csv(statewise_data, here::here("data/estimated_vs_actual_statewise_total_respondents.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# Print the resulting dataframe
print(statewise_data)
Key Adjustments:
Mapping of State Names to ICPSR Codes: Created a state_icp_mapping dataframe to map state names back to their STATEICP numeric codes. This ensures that merging is done based on the correct state identifiers.
Convert State Names Back to STATEICP Codes: The statewise_doctoral_counts dataframe is modified to include STATEICP codes before merging with the actual total respondents from the raw data.
Proceed with Calculations and Merging: Once the datasets share a common column (STATEICP), the script proceeds with the estimation, merging, and saving operations as previously outlined.
This approach should resolve the merging issue and align the two datasets correctly. Let me know if this works or if further modifications are needed!

write.csv(statewise_data, here::here("data/estimated_vs_actual_statewise_total_respondents.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# Print the resulting dataframe
print(statewise_data)
Changes Made:
Column Removal: After creating the final dataframe, I removed the STATEICP and Doctoral_Count columns.
Rounding Estimated Values: Used round() on Estimated_Total_Respondents to ensure it is rounded to the nearest integer.
This updated script should now produce the desired CSV with only the State, Actual_Total_Respondents, and Estimated_Total_Respondents columns. Let me know if this meets your expectations!

why is estimated now the exact same as actual?

If the Estimated_Total_Respondents is coming out to be the same as Actual_Total_Respondents, it indicates that the ratio calculation might not be implemented correctly. Let's go through the calculation step by step to ensure everything is working properly.

Steps to Check:
Ratio Calculation: Ensure that the ratio of doctoral degrees in California is correctly computed and applied to other states.
Merging Data: Verify that the merging of data from the two datasets is done correctly, ensuring we are pulling the correct counts.
Here's the corrected approach:
Calculate the number of doctoral degrees in California.
Calculate the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents in California.
Apply this ratio to estimate the total respondents for each state.
Here's the revised code that addresses the above:

r
Copy code
# Load necessary libraries
library(dplyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(here)

# Read the raw data file
data <- read.csv(here::here("data/data.csv"))

# Read the CSV file that contains the statewise doctoral counts with state names
statewise_doctoral_counts <- read.csv(here::here("data/statewise_doctoral_counts.csv"))

# Create a mapping of state names to 'STATEICP' codes
state_icp_mapping <- data.frame(
  STATEICP = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 11, 12, 13, 14, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 
               40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 51, 52, 53, 54, 56, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 
               67, 68, 71, 72, 73, 81, 82, 83, 98), 
  State = c("Connecticut", "Maine", "Massachusetts", "New Hampshire", "Rhode Island", "Vermont",
            "Delaware", "New Jersey", "New York", "Pennsylvania", "Illinois", "Indiana", "Michigan",
            "Ohio", "Wisconsin", "Iowa", "Kansas", "Minnesota", "Missouri", "Nebraska", "North Dakota",
            "South Dakota", "Virginia", "Alabama", "Arkansas", "Florida", "Georgia", "Louisiana", 
            "Mississippi", "North Carolina", "South Carolina", "Texas", "Kentucky", "Maryland", 
            "Oklahoma", "Tennessee", "West Virginia", "Arizona", "Colorado", "Idaho", "Montana", 
            "Nevada", "New Mexico", "Utah", "Wyoming", "California", "Oregon", "Washington", "Alaska", 
            "Hawaii", "Puerto Rico", "District of Columbia") 
)

# Convert state names back to 'STATEICP' codes for merging purposes
statewise_doctoral_counts <- statewise_doctoral_counts %>%
  left_join(state_icp_mapping, by = "State") %>%
  select(STATEICP)  # Retain only necessary columns for merging

# Calculate the actual total number of respondents in each state from raw data
statewise_total_counts <- data %>%
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Actual_Total_Respondents = n())

# Count the number of doctoral degrees in each state
doctoral_counts <- data %>%
  filter(EDUCD == 116) %>%  # Filter for doctoral degrees
  group_by(STATEICP) %>%
  summarise(Doctoral_Count = n())

# Merge the actual counts with doctoral counts
statewise_data <- statewise_total_counts %>%
  left_join(doctoral_counts, by = "STATEICP") %>%
  mutate(Doctoral_Count = replace_na(Doctoral_Count, 0))  # Replace NA with 0 for states with no doctoral degrees

# Define the total number of respondents in California (given value)
california_total_respondents <- 391171  # Given value for California

# Extract the number of doctoral respondents in California from the merged data
california_doctoral_count <- statewise_data %>% filter(STATEICP == 49) %>% pull(Doctoral_Count)

# Calculate the ratio for California using Laplace ratio estimator approach
california_ratio <- california_doctoral_count / california_total_respondents

# Estimate the total number of respondents for each state using the ratio estimator approach
statewise_data <- statewise_data %>%
  mutate(Estimated_Total_Respondents = round(Doctoral_Count / california_ratio))

# Select only relevant columns for output
statewise_data <- statewise_data %>%
  select(State, Actual_Total_Respondents, Estimated_Total_Respondents)

# Save the resulting dataframe to a new CSV file
write.csv(statewise_data, here::here("data/estimated_vs_actual_statewise_total_respondents.csv"), row.names = FALSE)

# Print the resulting dataframe
print(statewise_data)
Key Adjustments:
Doctoral Counts Calculation: We now calculate the number of doctoral degrees in each state from the original raw data.
Correct Ratio Calculation: We compute the ratio of doctoral degrees to total respondents using California's counts properly.
Filtering and Merging: We ensure that we are merging the actual and doctoral counts appropriately before applying the ratio.
With this implementation, the estimated total should be properly influenced by the actual counts and the ratio from California. Please try running this revised code and let me know if the issue persists!
