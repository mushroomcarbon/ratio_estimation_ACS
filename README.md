# Estimating state populations based on Californiaâ€™s doctorate holder ratio with ratio estimation

## Overview

In this paper, we use ratio estimation to estimate the total number of respondents of the 2022 ACS dataset by applying the ratio of doctorates to total respondents for the state of California to the other regions in the dataset. We then compared it with the actual number of respondents and analysed the results.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

- `data` contains the processed datasets that we used to generate the tables in the paper and during the analysis process
- `other` contains relevant details about LLM chat interactions
- `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the quarto document, the pdf, and the reference bibliography file.
- `scripts` contains the R scripts used to generate the processed data (.csv) files.

## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code were written with the help of ChatGPT - complete chatlogs can be found in ./other/llm.txt.
